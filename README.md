# weaver-test-extra

Provides extra functionality to https://github.com/disneystreaming/weaver-test

Currently, the following functionality is provided

## package `weaver.pure`

Provides minimal, ready-to-use API to `weaver-test`, that does not perform side effects
in order to compute the tests in a test suite (i.e. "register" a test).


# Why this library exists

Registration of a test to be ran by vanilla `weaver-test` rouglhy takes the form:

```scala
def register(test: Test): Unit
```

If we instead assume that it's always the suite which assembles and returns the `fs2.Stream` of
tests to be ran, we can reap the benefits of all our (test) code being referentially transparent.

In practice this is achieved in just a few lines of code. This library contains little code
aside from documentation.

See also [this article](https://dimitarg.github.io/pure-testing-scala/) for a more verbose treatment of why purely functional testing is a good idea.

# Getting started 

1. Add the following resolver to your project settings

```
resolvers += Resolver.bintrayRepo("dimitarg", "maven")
```

2. Add the following dependency to your build

```
"io.github.dimitarg"  %%  "weaver-test-extra"     % <latestVersion> % "test"
```

3. (Not specific to this library, this is a WeaverTest requirement). If you haven't already,
add the following to your project settings

```
    testFrameworks += new TestFramework("weaver.framework.TestFramework")
```

# Base concepts

, of which there is just one.

## Test

A test is defined as follows:

```scala
final case class Test(name: String, run: IO[Expectations])
```

That is to say, a test has a name, returns Ð° test result
`Expectations`, and is allowed to perform `IO` while doing so.


## Creating an `Test`

... can be done by constructing an instance of the above data type, either by calling its data constructor or 
via the function `weaver.pure.test`.

# Usage example

## Hello world

Here is a simple suite. You create one by extending `weaver.pure.Suite`, which requires returning a `fs2.Stream` of tests:

```scala
import fs2.Stream
import weaver.pure._
import cats.effect.IO
import java.time.Instant

object ExampleSuite extends Suite {

  override def suitesStream: fs2.Stream[IO, Test] = Stream(
      test("a pure test") {
          val x = 1
          expect(x == 1)
      },
      test("another pure test") {
        val xs = List()
        expect(xs == List())
      },
      test("an effectful test") {
        for {
          now <- IO(Instant.now())
          _ <- IO(println(s"current time: $now"))
        } yield expect(1 == 1)
      }
  )
}

```

This is pretty much 1:1 with what you'd write in `weaver-test` vanilla; with the important distinction
that the function `test` returns a value of type `Test`, instead of performing a side effect to register the test in some internal mutable state.

*A note on types:` "a pure test"` typechecks because there is an implicit conversion in scope
`Expectations => IO[Expectations]`. This is done so you don't have to write*
```scala
expect(foo == bar).pure[IO]
```
*over and over. (This is the same behaviour as vanilla `weaver-test`)*

## Suite of tests that share a common resource

I.e. like `beforeAll`, but not hideous.

### Detailed explanation

, but feel free to skip and just jump to the example below.

A test which requires access to some shared resouce of type `R` is just a function `R => IO[Expectations]`.

`weaver-test-extra` introduces the following data type for this purpose:

```scala
final case class RTest[R](name: String, run: R => IO[Expectations])
```

This can be constructed via its data constructor, or via the function `weaver.pure.rTest`.

Since a suite is a `fs2.Stream`, a suite whose tests can access a shared resource of type `R` has type `Stream[IO, RTest[R]]`

But since a `weaver.pure.Suite` requires returning `Stream[IO, Test]`,
we need a function

```scala
??? => Stream[IO, RTest[R]] => Stream[IO, Test]
```
, which turns a suite requiring some input into a suite with its input provided.

This is done by the function `provideResource`:

```scala
def provideResource(r: Resource[IO, R])(implicit ev: A =:= RTest[R]): Stream[IO, Test] =
```
, which when we remove the implicit cruft has type

```scala
Resource[IO, R] => Stream[IO, RTest[R]] => Stream[IO, Test]
```

I.e, given a description of how to build a resource, acquire that resource only once, 
and run all the tests, providing the resource as input to them.

Of course there is no magic here, you could have implemented that function yourself by
writing

```scala
def provideResource[R](resource: Resource[IO, R])(suite: Stream[IO, RTest[R]]): Stream[IO, Test] = {
  Stream.resource(resource).flatMap {
    r => suite.map(tst => Test(tst.name, tst.run(r)))
  }
}
```

### Example

```scala
import fs2.Stream
import weaver.pure._
import cats.effect.{IO, Resource}
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext
import java.util.concurrent.Executors
import cats.effect.Blocker

object ExampleResSuite extends Suite {

  val sharedResource: Resource[IO, List[String]] = for {
    ec <- Resource.make(
        IO(ExecutionContext.fromExecutorService(Executors.newCachedThreadPool()))
    )( x =>
        IO(x.shutdown)
    )
    blocker = Blocker.liftExecutionContext(ec)
    xs = fs2.io.readInputStream(
        IO(getClass().getResourceAsStream("/foo.txt")),
        1024, blocker, closeAfterUse = true
    ) 
    lines <- Resource.liftF(
        xs.through(fs2.text.utf8Decode).through(fs2.text.lines).compile.toList
    )
  } yield lines

  val suites: Stream[IO, RTest[List[String]]] = Stream(
    rTest("the file has one line") { lines =>
      expect(lines.size == 1)
    },
    rTest("the file has the expected content") { lines =>
      expect(lines == List("Hello, there!"))    
    }
  )

  override def suitesStream: fs2.Stream[IO, Test] =
    suites.provideResource(sharedResource)

  def foo[R](resource: Resource[IO, R])(suite: Stream[IO, RTest[R]]): Stream[IO, Test] = {
    Stream.resource(resource).flatMap {
      r => suite.map(tst => Test(tst.name, tst.run(r)))
    }
  }
  
}
```

No magic.

## Using subsets of a shared resource across multiple modules

Imagine the following use case

- You have a module of database tests requiring, say `transactor: Transactor[IO]`
- You have a module of http integration tests requiring, say `client: Client[IO]`
- You have a module of end-to-end tests, requiring an access to a multitude of resources,
say
```scala
final case class TestResources(transactor: Transactor[IO], client: Client[IO], config: Config, ....)
```

Furthermore, you want to initialise the resources common to multiple test modules (in this example `Transactor[IO]` and `Client[IO]`) only once.

A way to achieve this in this example is to
- Construct a value `dbTests: Stream[IO, RTest[Transactor[IO]]]` for the database tests
- Construct a value `httpTests: Stream[IO, RTest[Client[IO]]]` for the http tests
- Construct a value `e2eTests: Stream[IO, RTest[TestResources]]` for the end to end tests
- Combine the resulting streams into a single stream with type `Stream[IO, RTest[TestResources]]`,
using the `local` and `provide` functions

### `local`

The function is defined as follows

```scala
implicit class RTestStreamOps[R, A](private val xs: Stream[IO, A]) {
    def local[R1](f: R1 => R)(implicit ev: A =:= RTest[R]): Stream[IO, RTest[R1]] =
      xs.map(x => Contravariant[RTest].contramap(x)(f))
  }
```

Minus the implicit cruft this becomes

```scala
  def local[ParentRes](f: ParentRes => ChildRes)(xs: Stream[IO, RTest[ChildRes]]): Stream[IO, RTest[ParentRes]] =
      xs.map(x => Contravariant[RTest].contramap(x)(f))
  }
```

That is to say, we can go `Stream[IO, RTest[ChildRes]] => Stream[IO, RTest[ParentRes]]`, as long as we know how to go `ParentRes => ChildRes`. 

This works because `RTest` is `Contravariant` in `R`. This should be no surprise because
`RTest` is just a wrapper for a function, and functions are contravariant on their input

### provide

`provide` is like `provideResource`, but instead it takes `R` as input instead of
`Resource[IO, R]`. We use that when we have already acquired the shared resource in some external scope.

### Example

```scala
import fs2.Stream
import cats.effect.{IO, Resource}
import weaver.pure._


final case class FooResource()
final case class BarResource(value: Int)
final case class SharedResource(foo: FooResource, bar: BarResource)

object FooSuite {

  val all: Stream[IO, RTest[FooResource]] = Stream(
    rTest("the foo foos") { foo =>
        expect(foo == FooResource())
    }
  )
}

object BarSuite {
  val all: Stream[IO, RTest[BarResource]] = Stream(
    rTest("a barsuite test") { r =>
      expect(r.value == 42)
    }
  )
}

object ExampleSharedResSuite extends Suite {

  val mkSharedResource: Resource[IO, SharedResource] = for {
    _ <- Resource.liftF(IO.pure(println("acquiring shared resource")))
    res <- Resource.liftF(IO.pure(
      SharedResource(FooResource(), BarResource(42))
    ))
  } yield res

  val suiteUsingAllResources: Stream[IO, RTest[SharedResource]] = Stream(
    rTest[SharedResource]("some test")(res => {
      expect(res.bar.value == 42)
  }))

  override def suitesStream: fs2.Stream[IO, Test] =
    Stream.resource(mkSharedResource).flatMap { r =>
      suiteUsingAllResources.provide(r) ++
      FooSuite.all.local[SharedResource](_.foo).provide(r) ++
      BarSuite.all.local[SharedResource](_.bar).provide(r)
    }
}
```

Notes:
- `FooSuite` and `BarSuite` do not need to extend anything from `weaver-test` or `weaver-test-extra`, they are just containers of `Stream[IO, RTest[A]]` values. This of course also means they would not be auto-discoverable or runnable on their own.
